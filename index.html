                <h2>Online education has been growing in popularity for years, as it generally allows for flexible schedules and has allowed more people to access a high-quality and affordable education, using sites including <a href="https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="https://edx.org">edX</a>, and live streaming platforms including <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a> and <a href="https://meet.google.com">Google Meet</a>. edX and Khan Academy have a combined reach of over 124 million people, providing accurate and easy-to-access curricula over an extensive variety of subjects, including language arts, math, science, and more. However, online schooling has swept the nation in recent months due to school closures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the US and the world. According to a study conducted at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, when adequately prepared, students who predominantly learn in traditional settings can be just as successful and perform even better academically in a virtual setting. Unfortunately, many schools have poorly executed distance education programs, which has led to a reduced efficacy in learning and a negative experience for students, parents, and educators alike.</h2>

                <h2>When implemented correctly, distance learning can have a huge positive impact on students, allowing students to learn and excel in an environment that might be more familiar to them, especially those who wouldnâ€™t be able to access traditional education for one reason or another. But in its current state, distance learning is not optimal for students, parents, or educators.</h2>
